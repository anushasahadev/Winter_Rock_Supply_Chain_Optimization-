# 🏔️ Winter Rock Supply Chain Optimization

## 📌 Project Summary

This project was developed as part of a consulting assignment for **Winter Rock**, a UK-based winter sports retailer. The objective was to use **data analytics** to optimize sales forecasting, distribution planning, and supplier selection for a new product launch ahead of the winter season.

Winter Rock sells skiing, snowboarding, and climbing gear across the UK and internationally. With growing winter tourism and artificial ski slopes increasing local demand, the company needed data-driven strategies to ensure **efficient operations for the next six months (July–December 2022)**.

## 🎯 Goals

The project focused on 5 key business problems:

1. **Identify sales trends and seasonality** to inform marketing and inventory strategy.
2. **Forecast demand** for year-round products to maintain optimal stock levels.
3. **Optimize the distribution plan** to minimize shipping costs between two distribution centres and three UK regions.
4. **Evaluate supplier options** for launching new affordable mountain skis.
5. **Simulate real-world uncertainty** to test the profitability of new product demand using Excel-based simulations.

## 🧰 Tools Used

* **Microsoft Excel**: All analysis, modeling, and simulation
* **Excel Solver**: For distribution optimization using linear programming
* **Decision Tree Modeling**: To guide supplier selection
* **Time Series Analysis**: Moving average & exponential smoothing
* **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Demand variability modeling with random seed

## 🔍 What I Did

1. **Sales Trend Analysis**
   Analyzed historical sales (2019–2022) to identify seasonal demand peaks and guide inventory and marketing planning.

2. **Sales Forecasting**
   Used **Single Exponential Smoothing** to forecast year-round product sales and prepare for winter season demand.

3. **Distribution Optimization**
   Built a linear programming model in Excel Solver to **minimize shipping costs** from two warehouses to three UK regions.

4. **Supplier Decision Modeling**
   Created a **decision tree** comparing two suppliers for a new ski product under uncertain demand (risk-averse, risk-seeking, expected value).

5. **Monte Carlo Simulation**
   Ran a 1,000-sample demand simulation to evaluate **profit variability** and finalize the supplier decision.


## ✅ Key Outcomes

* Identified peak demand in Oct–Jan for strategic planning
* Recommended optimal stock levels and forecasted sales
* Reduced shipping costs with an optimized warehouse plan
* Chose the **USA supplier** for new product launch based on profitability and risk analysis
