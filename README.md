🏔️ Winter Rock Supply Chain Optimization

📌 Project Summary
This project was developed as part of a consulting assignment for Winter Rock, a UK-based winter sports retailer. The objective was to use data analytics to optimize sales forecasting, distribution planning, and supplier selection for a new product launch ahead of the winter season.

Winter Rock sells skiing, snowboarding, and climbing gear across the UK and internationally. With growing winter tourism and artificial ski slopes increasing local demand, the company needed data-driven strategies to ensure efficient operations for the next six months (July–December 2022).

🎯 Goals
The project focused on 5 key business problems:

Identify sales trends and seasonality to inform marketing and inventory strategy.

Forecast demand for year-round products to maintain optimal stock levels.

Optimize the distribution plan to minimize shipping costs between two distribution centres and three UK regions.

Evaluate supplier options for launching new affordable mountain skis.

Simulate real-world uncertainty to test the profitability of new product demand using Excel-based simulations.

🔍 What I Did
Sales Trend Analysis
Analyzed historical sales (2019–2022) to identify seasonal demand peaks and guide inventory and marketing planning.

Sales Forecasting
Used Single Exponential Smoothing to forecast year-round product sales and prepare for winter season demand.

Distribution Optimization
Built a linear programming model in Excel Solver to minimize shipping costs from two warehouses to three UK regions.

Supplier Decision Modeling
Created a decision tree comparing two suppliers for a new ski product under uncertain demand (risk-averse, risk-seeking, expected value).

Monte Carlo Simulation
Ran a 1,000-sample demand simulation to evaluate profit variability and finalize the supplier decision.
